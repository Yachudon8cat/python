To send SMS using Python, you can use the Twilio API. Twilio is a cloud communications platform that lets you send and receive text messages, phone calls, and video chats.
To get started, you'll need to create a Twilio account and get a free trial API key. Once you have your API key, you can install the Twilio Python library:
pip install twilio
Once the library is installed, you can write the following Python code to send an SMS message:
Python
import twilio

# Your Twilio account SID and auth token
account_sid = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID"
auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

# Create a Twilio client
client = twilio.rest.Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# Send an SMS message
message = client.messages.create(
    to="+15555555555",
    from_="+15555555555",
    body="Hello, world!"
)

# Print the message SID
print(message.sid)
This code will send an SMS message with the body "Hello, world!" to the phone number +15555555555. You can change the to and from_ phone numbers to any valid phone number.
To run the code, save it as a Python file (e.g. send_sms.py) and run it in a terminal:
python send_sms.py
If everything is successful, you should see the message SID printed to the terminal. You should also receive an SMS message on your phone.
You can also use Twilio to send SMS messages in bulk. To do this, you can use the MessagesClient.messages.create_multiple() method. This method takes a list of phone numbers and message bodies as input and sends an SMS message to each phone number with the corresponding message body.
For example, the following code will send an SMS message with the body "Hello, world!" to the phone numbers +15555555555 and +15555555556:
Python
import twilio

# Your Twilio account SID and auth token
account_sid = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID"
auth_token = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"

# Create a Twilio client
client = twilio.rest.Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# Send an SMS message to multiple phone numbers
messages = client.messages.create_multiple(
    to=["+15555555555", "+15555555556"],
    from_="+15555555555",
    body="Hello, world!"
)

# Print the message SIDs
for message in messages:
    print(message.sid)
This code will send two SMS messages, one to each phone number in the to list. You can add as many phone numbers to the to list as you want.
Twilio is a powerful tool for sending SMS messages from Python. You can use it to send single messages, bulk messages, and even scheduled messages.

print ('Hello Ali')
 input output in Python
 We get output in Python by using the fun
 'print'
e.g. 
x= 10 
print (x)
output should be 10.

x= Ali
print (x)
output should be Ali
x=100
y= 200
z= 300
print(x, y, z)
Output should be 100 200 300

-----------------------------------

Use of Comma(,) to print more than one output
e.g.
print ('Hello 1, 'Hello 2', 'Hello 3')
output should be 
Hello1, Hello 2 Hello 3

We use separater function (sep) in Python to
separate more than one output
e.g.
print ('Hello 1, 'Hello 2', 'Hello 3', sep= '~#~)
the output should be 
Hello 1 ~#~ Hello 2~#~ Hello 3

----------------------------------

Output via print is printed in next line 
e.g.

print ('Hello 1, 'Hello 2', 'Hello 3)
but if you want to the output to be printed one after the other
in a single line, use function (end= '=')
the output should be 
e.g. 
print ('Hello 1' , end= '=')
print ('Hello 2' , end= '=')
print ('Hello 3' , end= '=')

Hello 1 = Hello 2 = Hello=3


print ('Hello 1' , end = ' = ')
print ('Hello 2' , end = '= ')
print ('Hello 3' , end = '= ')

----------------------------------------

Printing out name and nationality of a person
We use function (name) and (country)

e.g
name = 'Ali'
country = 'Pakistan'
print( 'My name is' ,name, ' I am from', country)
 
Output should be
My name is Ali  I am from Pakistan

Now, in order to put 'and' in the above sentence
to make it sound correct we use (+) before the 
two functions name and country.

e.g. 

name = 'Ali'
country = 'Pakistan'
print( 'My name is' ,+name, ' I am from', +country)
 

print("Hello 1" , end = ' = ')
print("Hello 2" , end = ' = ')
print("Hello 3" , "Hello 4")
print("Hello" , "Hi")


Use of 'name' and 'country' function.
name = "Ali"
country = "Pakistan"
print("My name is", name, "and I am from", country)

---------------------------------------------

How to add string (str) in Python or concatenate or 
link together in a chain or series.
We use + sign before the fucntion 'name' and 'country'
e.g

name = "Ali"
country = "Pakistan"
print("My name is "+name+ " and I am from "+country)

How to print out age:We use str function to convert string into int.
e.g.
str(age)

such as;

name = "Ali"
country = "Pakistan"
age = 20
print("My name is "+name+ " and my age is "+str(age),"years")
 
 However, there is another way to concatenate/link or change typ
 We format by using 'f' before the entire sentence and 
 by putting the variable 'name' and 'age' etc. between
 {} two brackets.

 such as 
print(f"My name is {name} and my age is {age} years")
variable between {} i.e., name and age are considered to be the 
actual value of the variable which are between {}

 e.g.
name = "Ali"
country = "Pakistan"
age = 20
#print("My name is "+name+ " and my age is "+str(age),"years")
print(f"My name is {name} and my age is {age} years.")

------------------------------------------------

INPUT IN PYTHON:
To take input from the users/conversation etc. 
We use variable 'input' in Python to take input.

such as;
name = input ("Please enter your name")
print(name)
e.g.

name = input ("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"Your name is {name}")
#find out the type of variable 'name'
print( type(name))

Suppose we want to add two value x and y we have to take input 
from the user, use 'input' variable and then to get the right print
we will convert the string into integer. 
Such as;
x = (input ("Please enter x:"))
y = (input ("Please enter y:"))
z = x + y
print(f"Sum of {x} and {y} is {z}")

The input will be:
Sum of 10 and 20 is 1020 (which is wrong so here
we have to convert the string x and y into integer or numbers)
So we do the following

x = int(input ("Please enter x:"))
y = int(input ("Please enter y:"))
z = x + y
print(f"Sum of {x} and {y} is {z}")

So, when we want input from the user, we have to remember that 
input is alawys in string format and if we want 
to do mathematical exercise, we need to convert 
string into integer as we did in the above example.



x = input ( “Enter your name ”)
age = int(input ( “Enter your age”))
price = float(input ( “Enter the price”))

PYTHON DATA TYPES 
1. Numbers 
2. Boolean type
3. String
4. List
5. Tuple
6. Set
7. Dictionary


1. Numbers: In Python numbers there are three parts i.e.,
interger, float and complex.

Integer and Float
E.g. 
age = 20 (integer)
x = 30.4 (float)

If we want to find out the type of the number we
use the following syntax
print (type(age))

age = 20 
x = 30.4 
y = "600"

#If we want to find out the type of the number we
#use the following syntax
print (type(x))
print( type(age))
print( type(y))

output:
<class 'float'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>

Complex Number: This data type (number) include
both numbers and alphabats 
such as
x = 5 +10j
print(x)
print(type(x))

output should be:
(5+10j)
<class 'complex'>
 -------------------------
BOOLEAN Data Type:



a = '123'
b = int(a) + 1
print(b)
name = input('Enter:')
print(name)
apple= input('Enter:')
print(apple)
fruit = 'banana'
x = len (fruit)
print(x)

Complex numbers
there are two parts in complex Real part and Imaginary part
Python only deals with Real number;
Such as 

a = 5 + 10j
print (a)
a = 5 + 10j
print (a)
print(type(a))

x = bool ()
print(x)

is_raining = True

if is_raining:
  print("It is raining.")
else:
  print("It is not raining.")

  if is_raining:
  print("It is raining.")
else:
  print("It is not raining.")

is_rainy_day = is_raining and is_cold

if is_rainy_day:
  print("It is a rainy day.")
else:
  print("It is not a rainy day.")


  # Boolean values
is_raining = True
is_night = False

# Boolean expressions
1 + 1 == 2  # True
"hello" == "world"  # False

# Logical operations
is_raining and is_night  # False
is_raining or is_night  # True
not is_night  # True

# Conditional statements
if is_raining:
  print("It is raining.")
else:
  print("It is not raining.")

if is_night and is_raining:
  print("It is a rainy night.")
else:
  print("It is not a rainy night.")


#bool function: it has a few condition wherein it gives result accord
#to the condition such as 
#print(bool("")) the answer will be False since its an empty cell
#print(bool("Ali")) True
#print(bool(0))     False other than 0 any value will be True
#print(bool(5))     True
#print(bool(None))  False,none itsel is False
#print(bool("Ali", "Sher , Taha")) True, any value or str is True
#print(bool([]))    False empty cases report False.

#function- it also return boolean
#such as 
def myfunction():
    return False
print("Print Function's Result")
print(myfunction())



#Get address and zip code using Python
#pip install geopy

from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
#create the geolocator object with a suer-agent
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent= "geopiExercises")
#get the city from the user
place = input("Enter City Name: ")
#geocode the loction
location = geolocator.geocode(place)
#print the geolocation detials
print(location)

#How to download online videos (Youtube) in Python

import yt_dlp

#Enter the url for the download 
url = input("Enter url of the video: ")

ydl_opts = {}

with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download([url])

print("video downloaded successfully")
